# Backend test task
## Farm

The project is designed as a test task

## Technical task:
Implement a 'farm' with the ability to add and remove cows, output a report in a readable form

## What was done
Three files with different implementations: for the first part without restrictions on arrays needs only farm - "farm.js" with constructor of Array type, with restrictions - "cowNode.js" and "cowCustomArray.js", which must be used as type in Farm constructor.

If the terms of reference meant the restriction on "[" and "]" only for arrays, then both implementations are suitable, but if brackets cannot be used for objects too, then the cowCustomArray.js solution can be ignored

## How to start project
1. Clone repository
2. Run 'node src/index.js'

P.S
There are 3 sets of test data in index.js, you can increase the number of operations as you wish, in order to quickly switch and test different solutions, comment out the necessary parts of the code.
